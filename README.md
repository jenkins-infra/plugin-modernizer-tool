## About

OpenRewrite enables large-scale distributed source code refactoring for framework migrations, vulnerability patches, and API migrations via large-scale automated source code refactoring. While the original focus was on the Java language, OpenRewrite is continuously expanding language and framework coverage. The contributor will develop recipes to perform Jenkins plugin hygiene and migration tasks. It is hoped that through the completion of this project, the contributor will pick up skills in Java, OpenRewrite, and Jenkins plugin development.
